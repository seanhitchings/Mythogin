        <h2>Welcome to Mythogin</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="about-prose">
        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>
          Mythogin is an independent project dedicated to the examination of <span class="u-soft">American culture</span>
          by studying its roots in the stories we tell each other. We define <em>culture</em> as a force that shapes
          economic prosperity, national security, and the potential of every individual to achieve their life goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most influential stories shape culture for generations and become cornerstones of civilization.
          These take on mythic qualities that define human values and human aspirations. We study mythic storytelling
          not as fantasy, but as a living structure that informs our beliefs, identity, and actions.
        </p>

        <h3>Who Mythogin Is For</h3>
        <p>
          Storytelling is not reserved for authors or artists alone — it is central to how societies explain themselves,
          transmit values, and respond to crisis. Understanding stories is therefore essential to cultural renewal.
          We aim to spark curiosity, foster respectful debate, and encourage wider engagement with the narratives
          that organize modern life.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of us are consumers, transmitters, and producers of culture; we all have a stake in understanding
          the stories that shape our shared reality.
        </p>

        <h3>The Genesis of Mythogin</h3>
        <p>
          The name <em>Mythogin</em> was coined to represent the underpinnings of myth and the ways in which values and identity
          are transmitted and shaped throughout society.
        </p>
        <p>
          In English, many words associated with movement and creation trace back to the root <em>gen</em>, echoing the Greek
          <em>gennao</em>, meaning “to give birth.” But the root <em>gen</em> also overlaps with the Semitic root “JNN.”
          This word, pronounced “jin,” means to conceal, and thus became the basis for hidden forces or spirits that influence human affairs.
          Some of this was popularized in Persian myths, such as <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>. Centuries later, this influenced
          the English conception of “genies,” which make appearances in stories like “Aladdin.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Mytho-<em>gen</em> literally means “to give birth to myth,” but Mytho-<em>gin</em> takes a wider lens — examining not only how myths
          arise, but how stories evolve, decay, and are repurposed within modern economic and technological systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We intentionally chose a name distinct from commercial branding efforts that seek to commodify mythic language
          without engaging its deeper significance.
        </p>

        <h3>How We Work</h3>
        <p>
          Stories operate on several levels — from the surface plot, to the underlying values, to symbolic interpretation.
          We approach stories on a tripart basis:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Narrative structure:</strong> analyzing plot, characters, and techniques that determine whether a story is compelling or memorable.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural impact:</strong> examining how stories influence and are influenced by their historical context.</li>
          <li><strong>Constructive criticism:</strong> exploring how the story could be improved.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Through critical analysis and creative exploration, we invite objective examination of our culture.
          We analyze the values, principles, and worldviews embedded in stories, and how they influence beliefs and actions.
          This gives readers tools to form their own conclusions about the significance of those stories.
        </p>

        <h3>The Fierce Urgency of Now</h3>
        <p>
          When informed political debate collapses into binary identity politics, self-identity becomes central to the survival of the nation-state.
          If identity is tightly bound to an “us vs them” worldview — “heroes vs villains” — reality is replaced by fantasy.
          A fantasy cannot survive the war it produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is not the American story. Americans, more than any other people, have envisioned themselves as champions of freedom,
          opportunity, and prosperity. Our ideals—articulated in the Declaration of Independence and the Federalist Papers, and concretized in the Constitution—
          recognize that prosperity and security rely on an American identity that is broad, inclusive, and equitable:
          “We the people,” not “we the tribe,” “we the elite,” or “we the minority.”

        <h2>Editorial Note on Politics, Affiliation, and Political Correctness</h2>
      </header>

      <div class="about-prose">
        <p>
          This is not a partisan political site, but it is a site about culture—and culture exists within a political context.
          Some topics referenced directly or indirectly here may be construed as controversial.
          Asking questions can be constructive, not destructive. This site aims to be the opposite of clickbait.
        </p>

        <p>
          We acknowledge we live in a hyper-partisan world. Increasingly, political affiliation is treated not as a matter of debate, but as identity.
          We encourage everyone to lower their defenses and consider who we really are.
        </p>

        <p>
          After all, life is not monochromatic. There is not a red world or a blue world.
          The human body contains both red veins and blue veins, and the same oxygen sustains the whole of life—regardless of political affiliation or voting history.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most things made by human hands are value-neutral: whether something becomes good or harmful depends on its use and purpose.
          The same is true of markets: they can produce shared prosperity, mutual suffering, or inequitable benefit depending on conditions.
          Any critique here is aimed at specific cases—not at all people, firms, or industries.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <em>Mythogin</em> team represents a cross section of political and religious beliefs. We enjoy respectful conversation and debate.
          We strive for objectivity while exploring thought-provoking principles, and we don’t tailor our scope to whatever is politically correct on a given day.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are self-funded and have no political, religious, or economic agenda. We are not interested in advertising or alloying the content
          with outside business interests. If server costs ever become an issue, we may accept private donations—but never with conditions or strings attached.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please enjoy your visit to <em>Mythogin</em>. We hope it’s relaxing and enjoyable because there is no external pressure directing it.
